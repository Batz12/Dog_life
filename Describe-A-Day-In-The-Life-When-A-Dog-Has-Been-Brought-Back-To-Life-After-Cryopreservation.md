--------------------------------------------------------------PRELUDE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fingers of cold air swirled around the street, empty like souls of the people who were unlucky enough to witness the terrible incident . It was not a day like any other. Dark clouds filled the sky; a dark foreboding sense of unravelling fate. A rod of lightning pierced the sky and the heavens cried; the people's tears joined the rain as they gathered around the body. The sound of a cool breeze dominated the scene, the throats turned into dry spider caves, a constant lump and itch, a tear-filled, broken heart.The sunrise was a cruel piercing reminder to move on. The body had to be moved.The body of the dog lay barren on the road, its head cracked open bleeding. A small child stroking its head, consoling it, not knowing that it had moved onto a better place. The ambulance siren broke the silence, a constant, repeating wane of hope. The kid had to be moved ,the body put onto the carry bed and the ambulance drew away to the hosiptal 3 blocks away from the street. The kid walked towards the sunrise, its warmth was not a comfort but amplified the burning heart and hatred he held inside. In his mind, all hope was lost and the dog was confirmed dead!

 ------------------------------------------------------THE NIGHTMARE BEGINS-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Morning, 6:30am:

Mark, a gifted surgeon and experimental cryo-tech fanatic, woke up to the gentle warm brush of the sun across his face. Another day to save lives and make the world a little bit better. He pulled out a clean blue cotton shirt, a simple netted pattern;a light, smooth texture. Each square of the shirt independent, similar to each other but imperfect, knitted perfectly into a fabric that works. Each knit calculated and precise, a shirt that fills the wearer with confidence and contentment. The shirt looks regular but a heightened awareness makes these observations apparent. He wore the shirt along with simple jeans and the metallic silver mechanical watch gifted to him by his father and stepped out of his home.

Start of the work day, 9:00am:

Mark prepared the room for his 1st patient. The hospital bed had previously been prepared by the staff, the medical bottles and syringes organized and placed on a side table. The dog was rushed into the room by the nurses, its head covered in bloodied bandages, the eyes of the onlookers spared the details of the brutality. The dog was put on the bed to rest. Mark motioned to the onlookers to leave the room and started his work. He slowly unwound the bandages, revealing the dark husk of a dog that was once happy and lively. A deep cut down to the bone through its right eye, its upper jaw crushed teeth shattered but the bleeding under control. Mark frowned and exclaimed that it must have been a nice, happy dog. In a precise fashion, he cut the vein near the gash and the jaw and bypassed the cut so that the other side of the cut can be supplied with blood. After stablizing the dog after the procedure, the wounds were cleaned and the bandages reapplied. It now needed to get some rest but it was dying due to a more serious problem. 

Mark turned to go to the cafetteria to rest when he ran into his colleague, Felicia, who is a leading cryo specialist. Feilica asked, "Another dog with cellular degradation? What is happening in this city". She spoke with a very cold demenour, it was clear she also had a stressful day. Her blue eyes moved in a darting fashion, her mind working, thinking of the different ways she could be rid of her problems. Mark noticed this and asked her, "Your day too? This job is seems to be taking a toll on us recently. Atleast the grill cheese here is to die for". She laughed and nodded at his remark. No matter how stressful the day, there are always those moments that make life worth it. Her eyes now glistened brighter than the most beautiful ice caves in the world. Felicia knew what the task ahead demanded. She told Mark, "You and I both know the subject requires cryopreservation to slow down its cell degradation but its unlikely that the subject will live. All the previous dogs have failed the cryo trials". Mark now was a bit uneasy. He said, "If a life can be saved, we should try. I know it was a good dog. Maybe this time we can save the dog". Felicia smiled and said, "Yes, I suppose thats what our job demands.Let's stay in grill cheese heaven for now, we have a lot of work to do later".

Cryo lab, 8pm:

The cryo chamber filled the air with a heavy chilling hopeless feeling.The dog lay encased in the cryo tube as lifeless as a rock. Felicia can be seen next to the tube desperately feddling with the controls. She spoke nervously, "Ok the subject is stabilised, we have successfully stopped the cell degradation". Mark started to smile but he noticed Felicia was troubled. He spoke,"Don't worry, now that the subject is stabilised, its just about time until.....". This was when Felicia snapped, "No! The subject might be stablized but it has gone into a coma. Yeah maybe it can wake up.....but every other subject kept dying. I cant do this anymore.....everything we try to help dies". She broke down, a well of tears raining down on the floor, the chilled room now made both of them get hit by the looming ,shivering and depressing atmosphere. Mark felt a lump in his throat. It was true, they tried everything they could yet kept failing again and again. It was not the fault of either party but they found it difficult to not blame themselves. He hugged her and tried his best to console her. He spoke quietly, "Just know you are not in this alone. I care about you, we will get through this together ".The coldness of the chamber betrayed his efforts and  had robbed whatever warmth the hug could offer.     

------------------------------------------------------------------HOPE-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cryo lab, 9am:

A whole year has passed. The morning sun radiated the cold atmosphere of the cryo chamber. Felicia continued with her regular scheduled of performing the daily checks on the cryopreserved specimens. Suddenly she jumped back and exclaimed, "OMG! Its alive! Its alive!". The reading on the cryo tube encasing the dog showed that the dog was healthy and ready to be thawed out. She started the thawing process and looked down happily at her wedding ring,a beautifully cut diamond. A shining remainder that it is never too late to do something right, it is people that you are close to that make you want to be stronger. She quickly took her phone and called her husband, "Honey, the dog is alive! the dog is alive!". Tears of happiness flew down her cheeks as she talked. Mark burst through the door , tears welling in his eyes as well. Finally some form of redemption. Their efforts finally bore fruit. He hugged her, their tears absorbed on each others shoulders, the sun now warming the hearts of each other, filling them with a long overdue sense of happiness. 

The kid's house, 1pm:

Mark said, "Mr Jones, thanks for inviting us to the lunch. The mint pasta was simply delicious". Felicia gave out a light chuckle and looked outside the window to see the Jone's kid playing in the yard with his dog. A nice smooth coat golden retriever, happily running circles around the kid. The kid giggled as he continued to play fetch with it. He had been reunited with his best friend who he had thought to be dead. The dog's coat now reflecting the radiating sun, the eyes of the kid a bright shining diamond, the beads of sweat and tears on his face reflecting the warm radiance of the dog. Mark put his plate aside, washed his hands and joined Felicia near the window. He spoke, "On the day the dog was bought to me, i visited the dog's family after we placed the it in cryo preservation.The Jones kid was distant, broken. He sat in a dark corner with his head down, grinding his knuckles in anger. Mr Jones said the kid was the most happiest person in this neighbourhood but all that was lost when the dog was 'killed'. The kid lost a part of himself. I am glad we were able to save this dog. He is a good kid, he deserves better". Felicia smiled and took Mark's hand. They had a final look at the dog, it's tail waving in an enthusiastic manner and it's beady eyes glistening with love. It jumped into the kid's arms and he gently petted its head, occassinally playing with its ears. His eyes filled with tears of joy. A cold breeze passed by the yard but their bond strengthened by the warmth of the sun put a stop to the cold, chilling sensation. The kid had got his best friend back.
